1 	Write a program to implement the following sorting algorithms using user defined functions: a. Bubble sort (Ascending order) b. Selection sort (Descending order). 



2 	Write a program to implement the following using recursion a. Sum of n numbers b. Generate Fibonacci sequence c. Solve Towers of Hanoi Problem. 



3 	Binary Search Tree Operations (Recursive) a. Insert a node in BST b. Delete a node from BST c. Inorder traversal. 



4 	Write a program to Simulate the working of a Singly circular linked list providing the following operations a. Delete from the beginning/end b. Delete a given element c. Display &Insert is mandatory . 



5 	Develop a Program for the following: (a) Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent7 days of a week. Each 
Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a particular day (A dynamically allocated String). b) Write functions create (), read () and display (); to create the calendar, to read the data from the keyboard and to print weeksâ€™ activity details report on screen. 



6 	Develop a Program for the following operations on Strings. a. Read a main String 
(STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP) b. Perform Pattern 
Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in STR with REP if 
PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in STR Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use Built-in-functions. 



7 	Develop a menu driven Program for the following operations on STACK of 
Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX) a. Push an Element on to Stack b. Pop an Element from Stack c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack e. Display the status of Stack f. Exit Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations. 



8 	Develop a Program for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression. Program should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized expressions.
